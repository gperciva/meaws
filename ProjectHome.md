MEAWS (Musician Evaluation and Audition Workshop for Strings) is a program that provides objective feedback to music students.  It currently focuses on violin students.

This project uses [MEWES](http://code.google.com/p/mewes/) to generate the rhythm and intonation exercises.  The rhythmic exercises can also be practiced in the online game [MEWER](http://code.google.com/p/mewer/).

MEAWS was part of my Master's thesis, published in Aug 2008.  Due to copyright contractual issues, I cannot work on MEAWS until the summer of 2009, but rest assured that at that time I will continue improving it.  If somebody wants to fork this project and work on it before then, go ahead!  Just make sure you obey the GPL 3 license.  :)
